# 🏗️ Buildable3D – 3D Buildable Space Estimator & Renderer

Buildable3D helps architects, developers, and urban planners to **estimate buildable space** based on zoning rules and **visualize 3D models** of proposed buildings in real-time.


## Features
- **Lot Size & Zoning Input** – Enter land size, shape, and zoning regulations.
- **Buildable Area Calculation** – Automatically compute max allowable building volume.
- **Interactive 3D Rendering** – View a live, navigable 3D model of the building.
- **Adjustable Parameters** – Change height, floor count, and design constraints.
- **Export Options** – Download building models in common 3D formats (GLTF, OBJ).
- **Responsive Design** – Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## How it works
User can search up for an address, which will pull out land size, zoning limits, and other constraints from the database. Users can apply for different regulations avaliable to the area. Using the inputted information, backend calculates maximum buildable volume. 
Frontend renders a real-time 3D model using Three.js. User can adjust parameters to instantly update the 3D visualization.
